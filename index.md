## Welcome to my MODE web page.

Here is where I will be posting my work for my Mobile Development class. Enjoy your stay.

### About Me

My name is Ethan Jacalan. I am currently attending Durham College in my third year of Computer Programming and Analysis. This repository was created for my Mobile Development class (MODE 4201).

In my free time, I like to play music, table tennis, and video games.
